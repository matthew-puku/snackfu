# Answers to the Short Answer questions (Section 2.2)

## What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

## Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs 
solving?

## Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.

## Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.

## Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

## Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

## Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).

## Describe the architecture of your App.

## Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

## Detail any third party services that your App will use.

 Rspec – is a third-party technology that is used to test the Ruby application via automated testing. It is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby in production applications. Automated testing prevents regression and speeds up development as well as leads to writing better code.

Cloudinary - is a third party, cloud-based service that provides an end-to-end image and video management solution. The software is used so that video and images are not limited to local storage and can be accessed anywhere in the world.

Stripe – is a third party, online payment service that handles all the clients transactions. Using server checkout, allows the rails application to handle payments without storing the clients information on your server which prevents any stolen card information if application were breached.

Devise – is a popular third party authentication framework that handles all the controllers, models, and views that relate to authentication.  The gem comes with many different modules that allow for customization. The final product of adding the Devise gem, allows the rails application to create a login and signup form.

Heroku – is a third party company that allows developers to deploy and monitor their software. Heroku is easy to use and is fully managed which means that the applications are maintained on their cloud servers. Using this service allows the app to be accessed any where in the world.
